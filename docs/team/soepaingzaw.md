## Project: All-in-oneNUS

All-in-oneNUS is a desktop application for making university life easier in NUS. It has 4 different tools, and is
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is written in Java and has about 4 kLoC

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## CAP Calculator

***

### Noteable Features

* **List Feature**: Added ability to display modules and CAP
    * What it does: lists student's current semester's module data, CAP for your current semester and overall CAP
    * Justification: This feature outputs the main items of the CAP Calculator , the CAP for the semester and the
      overall CAP

    * Highlights: Calculates the CAP which requires arithmetic manipulation. Calculation of overall CAP is not trivial
      since we have to consider


* **View Feature**: Added a view command to allow student to view semesters
    * What it does: View module and CAP information for a certain year and semester
    * Justification: This feature enables the student to edit future modules to set the goal for his cap in advance


* **Goal Feature**: Added a feature to compute the CAP required in a semester in order to reach a desired CAP
    * Justification: Allows the student to be aware of the average grade band he needs to score in order to reach a
      certain grade level. Also allows student to simulate CAP to reach a certain grade level.


* **Show**: Added a show feature to display all modules from semester 1 to current sem
    * Justification: Allows the student to view all modules at a glance


* **Update**: Added an update feature for the student to increment their year of study
    * Justification: CAP Calculator will evolve together with the student as more modules will be taken.

* **Edit**: Add an edit feature so that the student can modify their grades
    * Justification: Allows the student to simulate their CAP and customize their grades to maximize their CAP. Enabling
      them to strategize each individual module grades
